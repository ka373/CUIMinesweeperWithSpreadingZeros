# SimpleCUIMinesweeperWithSpreadingZeros
■ This program is a simple CUI minesweeper in C. 

* Many people want to implement a Minesweeper game before learning data structures or algorithms in detail. This program is made to be recognizable and implementable to them as well.

■ I implemented the Spreading Zeros feature that many people who implement minesweeper games don't make.

* Spreading Zeros: When there are no mines in the eight blocks around a stepped block, the 8 blocks are also gradually treated as stepped on.

■ The exe file (MinesweeperCUI.exe) is produced by compiling the code in the Windows 7 environment. (Expect to work on Windows 7)

■ Purpose of the game

You can clear the game by stepping on all the ground except for the mines on the board.

■ Progress of the game

There is a board, and the game is played by stepping on it, marking a mine or "?".
